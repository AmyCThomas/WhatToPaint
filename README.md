# WhatToPaint
Gives ideas of what to paint/draw based on a subject

'git clone' the code from github ("WhattoPaint") to a local directory. Create a virtual envionment (i.e.: python -m venv .venv) on a drive with python installed, and
activate with source .venv/bin(or scripts if windows)/activate .
Make '.env' file from example  and add valid openai API key.
Enter pip install -r requirements.txt to load required apps
Type 'flask run' in terminal, after cd-ing to the correct directory to run, and it should show on localhost:5000
Enter a category such as those in the placeholder to be given some ideas for things to draw or paint.

I'd love to add functionality to this with their beta ai (which I signed up for) that may allow for image searches so that actual reference images could accompany this app.  I plan to attempt this with some current databases such as Getty images, but unfortunately discoverd this app too close to the deadline to be able to do more than I have here.  I'd also like to figure out how to seperate the responses on to their own lines, as nothing I'd tried so far worked, but will update this when I figure it out.
Thank you!!
